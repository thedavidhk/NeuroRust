# NeuroRust

NeuroRust is an open-source neural network library written in Rust, designed to
offer both efficiency and ease of use for machine learning enthusiasts,
researchers, and developers alike. This library provides the fundamental
building blocks to create, train, and evaluate neural networks, with a focus on
performance and scalability.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Build neural networks with customizable layers, neurons,
  and activation functions.
- **Efficient Computations**: Leverages Rust's performance advantages for fast
  and memory-efficient operations.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Suitable for various types of neural networks,
  including feed-forward and convolutional networks (future releases).
- **Easy-to-Use API**: Simplified interfaces for constructing and training
  models.

## Early Stages of Development

Please note that NeuroRust is currently in its early stages of development.
While functional, it is continually evolving, and more features and
optimizations are being added. We encourage users to experiment with the
library, provide feedback, and contribute to its growth.

## Getting Started

To get started with NeuroRust, include it in your Rust project's `Cargo.toml`
file:

```toml
[dependencies] neurorust = "0.1.0"  # Use the latest version
```

Then, import and use it in your project:

```rust
extern crate neurorust;

// Example usage here
```
